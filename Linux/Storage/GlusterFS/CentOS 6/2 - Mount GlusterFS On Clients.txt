### add the following entry on web1
192.168.1.1:/gv0 /var/www/external glusterfs defaults,_netdev,backupvolfile-server=192.168.1.2 0 0 


### add the following entry on web2's fstab
192.168.1.2:/gv0 /var/www/external glusterfs defaults,_netdev,backupvolfile-server=192.168.1.1 0 0 

### By doing this, each webserver is acting as a node in the clustered storage, 
### and also mounting 'itself' as a client so even though the files are technically 
### a network share, they're still locally accessible instead of remotely-via-network.
