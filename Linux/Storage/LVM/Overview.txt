So, what are Logical Volumes? Think of logical volumes on Linux as multiple disks 
and/or partitions working together, pooling their storage, for you. If you have two 
10gb disks, together they can provide a single 20gb "disk" for you to mount and use. 
If you're running out of space on that 20gb disk, you can (on the fly) add a new disk 
and expand that 20gb even larger without rebooting or unmounting the disk at all.

The LVM is broken down into 3 pieces:

 - Volume Groups: Mainly used for categorization, there's nothing wrong with have all of 
   your LV's in one group, or one LV per group. Think of it as two neighbors tossing a 
   ball back and forth. Each neighbor can be in their own respective yard, or both in the 
   same yard, does not matter.
 
 - Physical Volumes: These are the disk partitions assigned to a particular volume group
 
 - Logical Volumes: Slices of the pool of PVs formatted and mounted as disks for the OS.
 
 
If you plan on using LVMs for Big Data storage, I advise you google on planning ahead 
for VG/PV/LV layouts as they do have limitations that need to be considered before starting 
as these parameters cannot be modified once set for a VG/PV/LV, you'd have to destroy them 
and re-create from scratch. One article for example is http://www.walkernews.net/2007/07/02/maximum-size-of-a-logical-volume-in-lvm/
