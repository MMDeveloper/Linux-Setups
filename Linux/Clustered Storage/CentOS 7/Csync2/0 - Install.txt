### For each server that will sync with one another using csync2, follow these steps.

yum install gcc librsync librsync-devel sqlite-devel gnutls-devel

wget http://oss.linbit.com/csync2/csync2-2.0.tar.gz
gunzip csync2-2.0.tar.gz
tar -xvf csync2-2.0.tar
cd csync2-2.0
./configure && make && make install


openssl genrsa -out /etc/csync2_ssl_key.pem 1024
openssl req -new -key /etc/csync2_ssl_key.pem -out /etc/csync2_ssl_cert.csr
openssl x509 -req -days 600 -in /etc/csync2_ssl_cert.csr -signkey /etc/csync2_ssl_key.pem -out /etc/csync2_ssl_cert.pem


### There are two ways to run csync2. One way is via an inetd service which advertises near real-time syncing which would be fantastic, but I haven't had much luck getting that to work in CentOS 6+. This is why I run csync2 simply via a machine startup script (to start a listening daemon) and a cronjob to trigger the syncing.

cat "/usr/local/sbin/csync2 -ii &" >> /etc/rc.local
chmod +x /etc/rc.local

### Now, on one of the servers
csync2 -k /etc/csync2_ssl_cert.key

### Copy this keyfile to the exact same location to all over servers in this csync2 relationship
