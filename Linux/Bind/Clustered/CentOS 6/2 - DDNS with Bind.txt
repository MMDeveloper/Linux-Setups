### If you have DHCPD running on a linux box and wish to push DDNS to your BIND server, 
### there is a little bit more config to do. This should be done on your MASTER server only

### First you should refer to DHCP's configuration folder on how to do the first half of the configuration

vim /var/named/chroot/etc/named.conf

### paste this line near the top, outside of any declaration block
include "/var/named/chroot/etc/rndc.key";

### Now for each zone that will receive DDNS updates from Bind, put this as their allow-update setting
allow-update { key rndc-key; };

### Now cycle both BIND and DHCP and you should be good to go.
