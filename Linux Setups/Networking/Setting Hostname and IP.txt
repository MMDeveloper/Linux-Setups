### This is pretty generic across most all distros
### To set the machine hostname:
hostname myServer00

### Sometimes you might also need to set the hostname in /etc/sysconfig/network


### Setting a static IP is equally as easy. First, let's find the device name of your ethernet adaptor
ifconfig -a

### Usually it will be eth# or enp%%% assuming a wired adaptor, we will assume it's eth0
vim /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

### It will probably already be set to DHCP which makes it easy as we're only
### updating a file instead of creating from scratch.
### Change/add these values in the config to set the IP details
ONBOOT="yes"
IPADDR=192.168.0.7
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=192.168.0.1

### The NETMASK parameter may or may not be present, your particular distro may instead use a parameter called PREFIX or similar.
### Now that we've set the IP, Subnet, and Gateway address, we need to set our nameservers by editing the resolve.conf
vim /etc/resolv.conf

### we add our nameservers one per line
nameserver 192.168.0.7
nameserver 192.168.0.1
nameserver 8.8.8.8
