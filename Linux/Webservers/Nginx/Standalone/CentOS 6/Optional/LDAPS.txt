### If you plan on making LDAPS calls, you'll need to make your webserver trust the 
### CA certificate. Two ways to accomplish this. The easiest way is to make the webserver 
### trust any CA, the other way is to export the CA cert and import it into openSSL on 
### each webserver. I typically just have openSSL trust all CA certificates. Note that 
### this does NOT affect web browsing and for this entire configuration, only applies to LDAPS traffic.

### make sure the dependencies are installed
yum install openssl php56-php-ldap openldap

vim /etc/openldap/ldap.conf

### add this line
TLS_REQCERT     never
