### On the master you'll need to edit the mysql/mariadb config file and add these parameters to the mysqld section
### The server-id parameter must be unique for each server in the replication relationship, typically just an incrementing number

vim /etc/my.cnf

[mysqld]
server-id=1
log-bin=mysql-bin
binlog_format=ROW


### Now restart the db service
### Now access the db service from the command line on the master server.
### for example: mysql -h localhost -u root -p
### we need to create a user to be used for the replication procedure
### this will create a user account named 'repl_user' to be used by the slave server only

GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'repl_user'@'192.168.0.3' IDENTIFIED BY 'q2w3e4r5t6y7u8i9o0p';
exit

### Now we need to take a live backup of the databases on the master with special parameters
mysqldump -h localhost -u root -p --all-databases --flush-privileges --single-transaction --master-data=2 --flush-logs --triggers --routines --events --hex-blob >master.sql

### Now copy this backup file to the slave server using whatever method you prefer

### Now go back into the mysql/mariadb command line and run this
SHOW MASTER STATUS\G

### take note of the file and position, we'll assume the answers were
File: mysql-bin.000413
Position: 328
