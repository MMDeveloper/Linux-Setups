vim /etc/ntp.conf

### Now that NTP is installed, go to http://www.pool.ntp.org/en/ and drill down to find a pool of stratum servers to sync with 
### For me, that pool was 

server 0.north-america.pool.ntp.org
server 1.north-america.pool.ntp.org
server 2.north-america.pool.ntp.org
server 3.north-america.pool.ntp.org

### We need to tell our NTP daemon about these
vim /etc/ntp.conf

### paste the server lines in there, removing any existing entries
### we also need to restrict the NTP service to your LAN
### we will assume you're serving the 192.168.0.1-254 subnet
restrict 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 nomodify notrap


### restart the NTP service and verify functionality.
ntpq -p
