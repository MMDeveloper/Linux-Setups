### We will assume we have 3 Redis servers for the cluster, which is the minimum recommended
### Their IPs are 192.168.0.2-4

### on .2 run this
/root/redis-3.0.0-rc3/src/redis-trib.rb create --replicas 0 192.168.0.2:6379 192.168.0.3:6379 192.168.0.4:6379

### Let's say in the future you wish to add a fourth Redis server to the cluster with IP of .5
### On any Redis node, preferable the one you created the cluster.
./redis-trib.rb add-node 192.168.0.5:7000
