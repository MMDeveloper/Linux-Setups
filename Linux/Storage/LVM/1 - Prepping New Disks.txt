### Now let's see what new disks appear on the system, lets re-run this previous command
ls -lh /dev/sd*

### You should now see a new disk that wasn't present the last time we did this, we'll
### assume it is now /dev/sdc. We need to fdisk/prep this drive to be used in LVM 
fdisk /dev/sdc

### make sure there are no partitions on this drive
p

### if there are any partitions, remove them, else continue
### this key sequence will create a single partition, of type Linux-LVM spanning the entire disk.

### Now we need to "initialize" the new disk partition as a LVM's PV.
### From here on I like to reference the disk by uuid as I've been bitten
### in the past from using the friendly names
ls -lh /dev/disk/by-id/

### find the entry that points to your new partition, we'll assume it's
### /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000c5002186a33a-part3
pvcreate /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000c5002186a33a-part3
pvdisplay

### You should see your newly created sdc1 PV
