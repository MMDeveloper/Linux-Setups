With this type of cluster, you can reboot DB servers at will and no data loss will occur. The load balancer has a MySQL user that it uses to check the server is up. As soon as it senses the server is going down it immediately removes it from the pool until it's back up.

You can run updates on each server and reboot them at will. You can even stop the DB service, whack the entire /var/lib/mysql data directory and restart the DB service and it will rebuild it from the cluster (learned this while trying to break it). The easiest way to monitor the health of the cluster is by checking the cluster size. You can do this by running the following query on ANY of the DB servers in the cluster:

show status like 'wsrep%';

near the bottom of the results will be a record called something like "wsrep_clustersize" and it should be the number of servers actively in your DB cluster.

Any DB updates (including users, etc) are immediately replicated to other DB servers in the cluster. There are some known gotchas you should read about though. https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/mariadb-galera-cluster-known-limitations/
