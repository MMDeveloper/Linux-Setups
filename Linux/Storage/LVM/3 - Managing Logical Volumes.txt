### Now that we have our VG full of a pool of PVs (or in this case, only one PV), 
### we need to start carving out LVs to be mounted as disks
### If you want a fixed size LV from the vg_www's pool, and we'll name it www

lvcreate --size 10G --name www vg_www



### If you wanted to create an LV that uses up ALL of the space from the VG
### this would be if you created single-purpose VGs, for example, a VG solely for your /var/www directory
### and you don't want to fool around with specific PV sizes to make sure you don't
### waste space by guessing the size incorrectly

lvcreate --extents 100%FREE --name www vg_www




### Now that you've created your LV, we need to format it.
mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg_www/www


### Now we can mount it
mount /dev/vg_www/www /var/www







### IF YOU ARE ADDING SPACE TO AN EXISTING LV ###
### Once you've run pvcreate, and vgextend to prep the new disk partition
### You simply need to "lvextend" the LV and then resize the filesystem
### You can do this HOT without unmounting
### we'll assume the disk you're adding to an existing LV is /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000c5002186a33a-part4
lvextend /dev/vg_www/www /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000c5002186a33a-part4
resize2fs /dev/vg_www/www
