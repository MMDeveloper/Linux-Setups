### There are several bonding types, some require special programming at the Switch level, some do not.
### You should research which bonding method is right for you and your equipment.

### First let's load the bonding module if it's not already loaded
modprobe --first-time bonding 
modinfo bonding

### Now we need to create a config file for the virtual bond interface
vim /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond0

DEVICE=bond0
IPADDR=192.168.0.7
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=192.168.0.1
ONBOOT=yes
BOOTPROTO=none
USERCTL=no
NM_CONTROLLED=no

### These are the bonding options I mentioned earlier, you need to use your own research
### to choose the appropriate options
BONDING_OPTS="bonding parameters separated by spaces"





### Now, for each physical ethernet adaptor that will participate in the bond
### edit their respective ifcfg file in /etc/sysconf/network-scripts/
### remote all existing parameters from the file except device name and UUID (if present)
### Here's an example for my eth0 and eth1

vim /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

DEVICE=eth0
BOOTPROTO=none
ONBOOT=yes
MASTER=bond0
SLAVE=yes
USERCTL=no
NM_CONTROLLED=no

vim /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1
DEVICE=eth1
BOOTPROTO=none
ONBOOT=yes
MASTER=bond0
SLAVE=yes
USERCTL=no
NM_CONTROLLED=no




### Now restart your networking services
service network restart
#  OR
systemctl restart network.service
#  OR
### whatever your distro syntax is


### View the stats of your new bonded connection
ifconfig bond0
cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0
