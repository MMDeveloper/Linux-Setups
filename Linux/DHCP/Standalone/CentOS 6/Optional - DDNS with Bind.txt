### If you have DHCPD running on a linux box and wish to push DDNS to your 
### BIND server, there is a little bit more config to do.

### First we need to generate a rndc key
rndc-confgen -a -r /dev/urandom -t /var/named/chroot
chown named:named /var/named/chroot/etc/rndc.key

### That should make a /var/named/chroot/etc/rndc.key file with correct permissions
### Now we need to make a few config changes to dhcpd.conf
vim /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf

authoritative;
ddns-updates on;
ddns-update-style interim;
use-host-decl-names on;
allow client-updates;
include "/var/named/chroot/etc/rndc.key";

zone yourlocaldnsdomain.com. { #the dns suffix domain
        primary 192.168.0.7; #the IP address of the BIND server
        key rndc-key;
}

zone 0.168.192.in-addr.arpa. { #the reverse lookup zone
        primary 192.168.0.7; #the IP address of the BIND server
        key rndc-key;
}


### Now, in your subnet config, just add the DNS suffix if it's not already there
option domain-name "yourlocaldnsdomain.com";

### Now refer to BIND's documentation for its half of this relationship 
### and restart both DHCP and Bind and you should be good to go.
