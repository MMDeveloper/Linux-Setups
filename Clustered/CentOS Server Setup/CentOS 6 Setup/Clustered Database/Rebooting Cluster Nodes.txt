You can reboot cluster nodes as often as you like, whenever you like. The only "thing" is that at least ONE node must remain up to keep the cluster alive. If at ANY point ALL cluster nodes go down. You will need to bootstrap a new cluster following the "Building the Cluster" instructions.. FEAR NOT YOUR DATA IS NOT GONE.

Just pick a server, change the gcomm address, bootstrap the new cluster, restart the DB service on any of the other nodes, revert the gcomm address on the first node and cycle the DB service there. Cycle the DB service on all the other nodes and they will also auto-rejoin the cluster and sync.
