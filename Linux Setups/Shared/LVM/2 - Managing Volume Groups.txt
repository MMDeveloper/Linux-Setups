### If you are creating a new Volume Group and not expanding an existing one
### think of a name for your VG, it must be unique amongst future VGs on this vg_server_0
### and should describe the purpose of the PVs within it
vgcreate vg_www /dev/sdc1




### If you were adding this partition to an EXISTING volume group, you would first
### need to know the exact name of the volume group which you can obtain by running
vgdisplay

### I'll assume we're adding this new partition to an existing VG named "vg_www"
vgextend vg_www /dev/sdc1
