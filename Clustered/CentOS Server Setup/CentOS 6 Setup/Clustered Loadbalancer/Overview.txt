For an HA setup and true load balancing, I personally prefer to deploy HAProxy. Load balancing requests for HA does no good with a single HAProxy server as that provides a single point of failure. It is recommended to have at least 2, using keepalived to setup your HAProxy servers in an active/standby cluster via a heartbeat. 

To achieve this you'll need N+1 IP addresses, one for each HAProxy server and one 'Floating IP' that is passed around. This "Floating IP" is the IP address that should be used to send traffic to your cluster/farm of servers; it is the internal IP that should be NAT'd to the outside world.

For the following documents, I will make the following assumptions:

* You will have two HAProxy servers
* HAProxy0
** Heartbeat IP: 192.168.0.3
* HAProxy1
** Heartbeat IP: 192.168.0.4
* Floating IP: 192.168.0.2

Follow the sub-instructions on each HAProxy server.

At the time of this writing, the HAProxy configuration passes ALL SSL tests performed via https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest with 100% Grade-A results.
