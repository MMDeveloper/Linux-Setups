### These instructions should be performed on ALL webservers. It's important you 
### keep each webserver identical to one another so the runtime environments are 
### the same no matter which server a user is load balanced on. If you want, you 
### can do the install and clone the webserver to as many as you want. Be sure to 
### do this BEFORE you start the Cluster Storage sections.

### I prefer nginx all day over any other webserver. After installation typically 
### I'll create the following directory structure:

### slow-sync'd directories here. This is covered under Cluster Storage
### only used for shared config files and such
mkdir -p /var/www/internal/conf/php-fpm/pools/


### the 'internal' folder is used for config files and other 'portable' items that 
### don't need realtime syncing, rather a slower sync schedule is fine. The reasoning 
### for this is covered under Cluster Storage.
