### Now let's see what new disks appear on the system, lets re-run this previous command
ls -lh /dev/sd*

### You should now see a new disk that wasn't present the last time we did this, we'll
### assume it is now /dev/sdc. We need to fdisk/prep this drive to be used in LVM 
fdisk /dev/sdc

### make sure there are no partitions on this drive
p

### if there are any partitions, remove them, else continue
### this key sequence will create a single partition, of type Linux-LVM spanning the entire disk.

### Now we need to "initialize" the new disk partition as a LVM's PV.
pvcreate /dev/sdc1
pvdisplay

### You should see your newly created sdc1 PV
### Now run this command to get the UID of the partition as we will
### use that from now on
ls -lh /dev/disk/by-id | grep sdc1

### for the purposes of this documentation, we'll assume it was
/dev/disk/by-id/lvm-pv-uuid-JK60sV-Mc1e-RZlD-eeeB-h4qK-xFtn-iyZfHV
